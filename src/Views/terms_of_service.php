                        Licensee’s users’ data to UNS via the API for processing by UNS (each such event, a
                        “<strong><em>Query</em></strong>”). In response to Queries, UNS will process such User Data,
                        prepare Results for consumption by Licensee, and send such Results to Licensee via the API.
                    </li>
                    <li><u>License Grant</u>. Subject to Licensee’s full compliance with all of the terms and conditions
                        of this Agreement, UNS hereby grants to Licensee a limited, nonexclusive, non-sublicensable and
                        non-transferable right and license during the Term to: (i) access and use the API to send
                        Licensee Data to UNS and receive Results from UNS; (ii) use the Results for Licensee’s internal
                        business purposes; and (iii) use, and make a reasonable number of copies of any technical
                        documentation for the API provided by UNS for use in connection with the API (the “<strong><em>Documentation</em></strong>”)
                        solely in connection with the exercise of Licensee’s rights under this Section 1(b). Licensee

                    </li>
                    <li><u>Updates</u>. During the Term, UNS may provide Licensee with Updates that UNS may, in its sole
                        discretion, make generally available to its licensees at no additional charge. Licensee must
                        install all Updates as soon as practicable after receipt. UNS will not be responsible for any
                        all losses, liabilities, costs, expenses (including reasonable attorneys’ fees), claims, suits,
                        and actions that may arise from or relate to any acts or omissions from Licensee’s failure to
                        timely implement any Updates made available by UNS to Licensee.
                        “<strong><em>Updates</em></strong>” means any update, upgrade, release, or other adaptation or
                        modification of the API, including any updated Documentation, that UNS may provide to Licensee

                        to: (i) create or disclose metrics about, perform any statistical analysis of, or otherwise
                        prepare any benchmarking analysis of the API or the Results for disclosure to third-parties;
                        (ii) use the API or Results on behalf of any third-party; (iii) copy, rent, lease, sell,
                        transfer, assign, sublicense, dissemble, reverse engineer or decompile (except to the limited
                        extent expressly authorized under applicable statutory law), modify or alter any part of the
                        API; (iv) use the API in a manner that impacts the stability of UNS’s servers or impacts the
                        behavior of other customers or applications using the API; (v) use the API or Results in any
                        manner or for any purpose that may violate any applicable law, rule, or regulation, or any right
                        of any person, including without limitation any intellectual property or other proprietary
                        rights, or which may otherwise be harmful to UNS or its UNSs or suppliers; (vi) publish, post,

                        detrimentally interfere with, surreptitiously intercept or expropriate any systems, data,
                        personal information or property of another; or (vii) remove any copyright or proprietary
                        notices contained in the API or Results.

                    <li><u>Usage Rights</u>. By submitting Licensee Data to UNS, Licensee hereby grants, and represents
                        and warrants that it has all rights necessary to grant, all rights and licenses to the Licensee
                        Data required for UNS. UNS shall have no right to sublicense or resell Licensee Data, except
                        however, that UNS may collect, analyze, and use data derived from Licensee Data as well as data
                        about Licensee’s use of the API, solely for the purposes of operating, analyzing, improving, or
                        marketing the API and any related services. UNS may: (a) track the number of users of, and
                        interactions with, the API on an anonymized aggregate basis; (b) analyze aggregated usage
                        patterns for product development efforts; or (c) use anonymous data derived from Licensee Data
                        in a form which may not reasonably identify either a particular individual or the user to
                        develop further analytic frameworks and application tools. Licensee further agrees that UNS will
                        have the right, both during and after the Term, to use, store, transmit, distribute, modify,
                        copy, display, sublicense, and create derivative works of the anonymized and/or aggregated data.

            <li><u>Technical Support</u>. UNS will provide the Licensee, based on Licensee’s subscription level,
                commercially reasonable technical support for the API and Services at its discretion.
            </li>
            <li><u>Additional Services</u>. UNS may provide additional services in connection with the performance of
                this Agreement, which may include integration, training, and ongoing maintenance and support services (“<strong><em>Services</em></strong>”).
                Such Services (if any) shall be memorialized in a written statement of work
                (“<strong><em>SOW</em></strong>”) executed by both Parties.
            </li>
            <li><u>Ownership</u>. As between UNS and Licensee: (a) all Licensee Data is and will remain the sole and
                exclusive property of Licensee; and (b) the API, Results, and UNS Data are and will remain the sole and
                exclusive property of UNS. “<strong><em>UNS Data</em></strong>” means any data that is generated by the
                API or otherwise by UNS in the course of performing its obligations under this Agreement, including
                without limitation, API usage data.
            </li>
            <li><u>Reservation of Rights</u>. UNS reserves all rights not expressly granted to Licensee in this
                Agreement. Except for the limited rights and licenses expressly granted under this Agreement, nothing in
                this Agreement grants, by implication, waiver, estoppel, or otherwise, to Licensee or any third party
                any intellectual property rights or other right, title, or interest in or to the API.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>LICENSEE RESPONSIBILITIES</strong>. Licensee is responsible and liable for all uses of the API resulting
        from access provided by Licensee, directly or indirectly, whether such access or use is permitted by or in
        violation of this Agreement. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, Licensee is responsible for all
        acts and omissions of Licensee’s end users in connection with their use of the API, if any. Any act or omission
        by Licensee’s end users that would constitute a breach of this Agreement if taken by Licensee will be deemed a
        breach of this Agreement by Licensee. Licensee shall take reasonable efforts to make all of Licensee’s end users
        aware of this Agreement’s provisions as applicable to such end user’s use of the API and shall cause end users
        to comply with such provisions.
    </li>
    <li><strong>FEES</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Fees</u>. In consideration of UNS’s performance of its obligations hereunder, Licensee will pay the
                fees specified in an applicable Order and any applicable SOW (the “<strong><em>Fees</em></strong>”). UNS
                may, in its sole discretion, increase or otherwise modify the Fees at each renewal period while this
                Agreement is in effect. If Licensee does not agree to the new or changed Fees, Licensee may terminate
                this Agreement upon thirty (30) days’ notice to UNS.
            </li>
            <li><u>Taxes</u>. Licensee will be responsible for the payment of any and all local, state, federal, or
                foreign taxes, levies, and duties of any nature, including value-added, sales, use, and withholding
                taxes (“<strong><em>Taxes</em></strong>”), but not taxes on the net income of UNS. Licensee is
                responsible for paying all Taxes, excluding only taxes based on UNS’s net income. If UNS has the legal
                obligation to pay or collect Taxes for which Licensee is responsible under this Section 3.2, the
                appropriate amount shall be invoiced to and paid by Licensee unless Licensee provides UNS with a valid
                tax exemption certificate authorized by the appropriate taxing authority.
            </li>
            <li><u>Payment Terms</u>. All amounts payable to UNS under this Agreement will be due within thirty (30)
                days from the date of an invoice. Overdue payments will be subject to interest at the rate of 1-1/2% per
                month, or the maximum allowable under applicable law, whichever is less.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>TERM AND TERMINATION</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Term</u>. This Agreement commences on the Effective Date and continues until terminated as provided
                herein (the “<strong><em>Term</em></strong>”). All fees paid hereunder are non-refundable. Licensee will
                not be entitled to any refund in the event Licensee terminates this Agreement for convenience (as
                described in Section 4.2 below). In the event UNS terminates this Agreement for convenience (as
                described in Section 4.2 below), Licensee will only be entitled to a refund for the Fees paid hereunder,
                less an amount determined by multiplying the Fees paid for such API or such module during the Term by a
                fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months during the Term during which Licensee had use
                of the API and the denominator of which is the total number of months during the Term.
            </li>
            <li><u>Termination</u>. Either Party may terminate this Agreement and/or any Order and SOWs for any reason
                or for no reason by providing Licensee at least thirty (30) days’ prior written notice (“<strong><em>Termination
                        for Convenience</em></strong>”). Either Party may terminate the Agreement and/or an Order and
                SOW upon thirty (30) days’ written notice if (a) the other Party has breached this Agreement and not
                cured such breach within such notice period, or (b) the other Party becomes insolvent, makes a general
                assignment for the benefit of creditors, suffers or permits the appointment of a receiver for its
                business or assets, initiates or becomes subject to any proceeding under any bankruptcy or insolvency
                law, or has wound up or liquidated its business. If UNS is seeking to terminate based on Licensee’s
                failure to pay undisputed fees due hereunder, the cure period will be ten (10) days. Except where an
                exclusive remedy may be specified, the exercise by either Party of any remedy, including termination,
                will be without prejudice to any other remedies it may have under this Agreement, by law or otherwise.
            </li>
            <li><u>Effect of Termination</u>. Any termination of this Agreement will automatically terminate any and all
                Orders and SOWs issued hereunder. If the Agreement is not renewed, the Agreement will remain in effect
                for the remainder of any then-open Orders and SOWs and will expire upon the expiration or termination of
                all such Orders and SOWs. Subject to the preceding sentence, upon any termination or expiration of this
                Agreement: (a) all provisions that should survive any termination or expiration of this Agreement will
                survive except, for purposes of clarity and without limitation, Licensee’s right to access and use the
                API; and (b) each Party (as recipient) will immediately cease use of and return the other Party’s
                Confidential Information or destroy it and certify destruction. For the avoidance of doubt, UNS is not
                required to return or destroy any UNS Notwithstanding the foregoing, following any termination or
                expiration of this Agreement, Licensee may continue to use any Results transmitted by UNS to Licensee
                for Licensee’s internal business purposes.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li><strong>CONFIDENTIALITY</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Definition</u>. “<strong><em>Confidential Information</em></strong>” means any information or
                materials provided by the Party (“<strong><em>Discloser</em></strong>”) to the other Party
                (“<strong><em>Recipient</em></strong>”) whether or not marked, designated, or otherwise identified as
                “confidential” or “proprietary”, or, information which, under the circumstances of disclosure, a
                reasonable person would have known to be confidential or proprietary, whether in tangible, intangible,
                visual, oral, written, or electronic form. Without limiting the generality of the foregoing, the
                following information shall be considered Confidential Information: this Agreement, information
                regarding UNS’s pricing, product roadmap or strategic marketing plans and non-public materials relating
                to UNS’s products and services, including the API, UNS Data, and Services.
            </li>
            <li><u>Duty</u>. Recipient may use Confidential Information of Discloser solely to exercise its rights and
                perform its obligations under this Agreement. Recipient will not use any Confidential Information of
                Discloser for any purpose not expressly permitted by this Agreement, and will disclose the Confidential
                Information of Discloser only to the employees, contractors, and agents of Recipient who have a need to
                know such Confidential Information and who are under a duty of confidentiality similar to Recipient’s
                duty hereunder (“<strong><em>Representatives</em></strong>”). Recipient will protect Confidential
                Information from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner as Recipient protects its
                own confidential or proprietary information of a similar nature but with no less than reasonable care.
                Recipient will be responsible for all acts and omissions of its Representatives hereunder.
            </li>
            <li><u>Exclusions</u>. Recipient’s obligations under this Section 5 with respect to any Confidential
                Information shall not apply if Recipient can show by written records that such information: (a) was
                already known to Recipient at the time of disclosure by Discloser; (b) was disclosed to Recipient by a
                third party who had the right to make such disclosure without any confidentiality restrictions; (c) is,
                or through no fault of Recipient has become, generally available to the public; or (d) was independently
                developed by Recipient without use of, reference to or reliance upon, or reference to Discloser’s
                Confidential Information. In addition, Recipient will be allowed to disclose Confidential Information to
                the extent that such disclosure is required by law or by the order of a court of similar judicial or
                administrative body, provided that Recipient notifies Discloser of such required disclosure promptly and
                in writing and cooperates with Discloser, at Discloser’s request and expense, in any lawful action to
                contest or limit the scope of such required disclosure.
            </li>
            <li><u>Feedback</u>. To the extent Licensee provides any suggestions, recommendations or other feedback
                relating to any UNSproducts or services, including without limitation the API, UNS Data, and Services
                (collectively, “<strong><em>Feedback</em></strong>”), UNS may utilize such Feedback and any ideas,
                concepts, know-how and techniques, derived therefrom without any further compensation or other
                obligation with respect thereto; provided that Licensee is not publicly identified as the source of the
                Feedback.

                knowledge of the Party threatened, that challenges or may have a material adverse effect on this

                        claim, action, or proceeding brought against Licensee by a third-party to the extent based upon
                        a claim that the API infringes any U.S. copyright or trademark or misappropriates any U.S. trade
                        secret of any such third-party and will pay such damages or costs as are finally awarded against
                        Licensee by a court (or mediator or arbitrator, if applicable) of competent jurisdiction or are
                        agreed to in a settlement that are attributable to such claim.
                    </li>
                    <li><u>UNS Options</u>. Should the API become, or in the opinion of UNS be likely to become, the
                        subject of such an infringement claim, UNS may, at its option (i) procure for Licensee the right
                        to use the API at no cost to Licensee; (ii) replace or modify, in whole or in part, the API to
                        make it non-infringing; or (iii) if neither (i) nor (ii) are, in UNS’s sole and absolute
                        discretion, commercially practicable, accept return of the API, or remove the allegedly
                        offending module thereof, and, refund the Fees paid for such API or module by Licensee.
                    </li>
                    <li><u>Exclusions from UNS Indemnity</u>. UNS assumes no liability hereunder for: (i) any method or
                        process in which the API, Results, or Services may be used; (ii) any compliance with Licensee’s
                        specifications; (iii) use of software other than current unaltered releases of the applicable
                        API; (iv) the combination, operation or use of the API, Results, or Services with
                        non-UNSprograms or data; or (v) the unauthorized access or use of the User Materials, and

                        agents, successors and assigns against any damages, losses, and expenses (including reasonable
                        attorneys’ fees) arising from any third-party action to the extent based upon a claim of any
                        kind based on any of the foregoing factors in (i) through (v) (inclusive) above.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><u>Licensee Indemnification</u>. Licensee shall defend, indemnify, and hold harmless UNS and its
                officers, directors, employees, agents, successors and assigns from and against any and all claims,
                damages, obligations, losses, liabilities, costs or debt, and expenses (including but not limited to
                attorneys’ fees) arising from or relating to: (a) UNS’s processing and use of the Licensee Data in UNS’s
                preparation of Results as contemplated in this Agreement; or (b) Licensee’s or its Representatives’: (i)

            </li>
            <li><u>Indemnity Procedures</u>. The Party seeking indemnification (the “<strong><em>Indemnified Party</em></strong>”)
                shall provide the Party from whom indemnification is sought (the “<strong><em>Indemnifying
                        Party</em></strong>”) with: (a) prompt written notice of any claim for which indemnification is
                sought (provided that a failure to provide such notice shall not relieve the Indemnifying Party of its
                obligations hereunder except to the extent material prejudice results from such failure); (b) sole
                control over the defense and settlement of the claim (provided that neither Party may enter into a
                settlement of any kind that places any material obligation on the other Party, or requires the other
                Party to admit any liability, without the other Party’s prior written approval, which will not be
                unreasonably withheld, conditioned, or delayed); and (c) all reasonable cooperation, at the Indemnifying
                Party’s request and expense, in the defense and settlement of the claim.
            </li>
            <li><u>Sole Remedy for Infringement</u>. THIS SECTION 8.4 SETS FORTH UNS’S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND LICENSEE’S

    <li><strong>MISCELLANEOUS</strong>
        <ul>
            <li><u>Entire Agreement</u>. This Agreement, together with any other documents incorporated herein by
                reference, constitutes the sole and entire agreement of the Parties with respect to the subject matter
                of this Agreement and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous understandings, agreements, and
                representations and warranties, both written and oral, with respect to such subject matter. In the event
                of any inconsistency between the statements made in the body of this Agreement and any other documents
                incorporated herein by reference, the following order of precedence governs: (a) first, this Agreement,
                excluding its Exhibits; and (b) any other documents incorporated herein by reference.
            </li>
            <li><u>Notices</u>. All notices, requests, consents, claims, demands, waivers, and other communications
                hereunder (each, a “<strong><em>Notice</em></strong>“) must be in writing and addressed to the Parties
                at the addresses set forth on the first page of this Agreement (or to such other address that may be
                designated by the Party giving Notice from time to time in accordance with this Section 9.2). All
                Notices must be delivered by personal delivery, nationally recognized overnight courier (with all fees
                pre-paid), facsimile, or email (with confirmation of transmission) or certified or registered mail (in
                each case, return receipt requested, postage pre-paid). Except as otherwise provided in this Agreement,
                a Notice is effective only: (i) upon receipt by the receiving Party, and (ii) if the Party giving the
                Notice has complied with the requirements of this Section 9.2.
            </li>
            <li><u>Force Majeure</u>. In no event shall either Party be liable to the other Party, or be deemed to have
                breached this Agreement, for any failure or delay in performing its obligations under this Agreement,
                (except for any obligations to make payments), if and to the extent such failure or delay is caused by
                any circumstances beyond such Party’s reasonable control, including but not limited to acts of God,
                flood, fire, earthquake, explosion, war, terrorism, invasion, riot or other civil unrest, strikes, labor
                stoppages or slowdowns or other industrial disturbances, or passage of law or any action taken by a
                governmental or public authority, including imposing an embargo.
            </li>
            <li><u>Amendment and Modification; Waiver</u>. No amendment to or modification of this Agreement is
                effective unless it is in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each Party. No waiver by
                any Party of any of the provisions hereof will be effective unless explicitly set forth in writing and
                signed by the Party so waiving. Except as otherwise set forth in this Agreement, (a) no failure to
                exercise, or delay in exercising, any rights, remedy, power, or privilege arising from this Agreement
                will operate or be construed as a waiver thereof and (b) no single or partial exercise of any right,
                remedy, power, or privilege hereunder will preclude any other or further exercise thereof or the
                exercise of any other right, remedy, power, or privilege.
            </li>
            <li><u>Severability</u>. If any provision of this Agreement is invalid, illegal, or unenforceable in any
                jurisdiction, such invalidity, illegality, or unenforceability will not affect any other term or
                provision of this Agreement or invalidate or render unenforceable such term or provision in any other
                jurisdiction. Upon such determination that any term or other provision is invalid, illegal, or
                unenforceable, the Parties hereto shall negotiate in good faith to modify this Agreement so as to effect
                the original intent of the Parties as closely as possible in a mutually acceptable manner in order that
                the transactions contemplated hereby be consummated as originally contemplated to the greatest extent
                possible.
            </li>
            <li><u>Governing Law; Submission to Jurisdiction</u>. This Agreement is governed by and construed in
                accordance with the internal laws of the State of Delaware without giving effect to any choice or
                conflict of law provision or rule that would require or permit the application of the laws of any
                jurisdiction other than those of the State of Delaware. Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising
                out of or related to this Agreement or the licenses granted hereunder may be instituted in the federal
                courts of the United States or the courts of the State of Delaware, and each Party irrevocably submits
                to the exclusive jurisdiction of such courts in any such suit, action, or proceeding.
            </li>
            <li><u>Assignment</u>. Licensee may not assign or transfer any of its rights or delegate any of its
                obligations hereunder, in each case whether voluntarily, involuntarily, by operation of law or
                otherwise, without the prior written consent of UNS. Any purported assignment, transfer, or delegation
                in violation of this Section 9.7 is null and void. No assignment, transfer, or delegation will relieve
                the assigning or delegating Party of any of its obligations hereunder. This Agreement is binding upon
                and inures to the benefit of the Parties hereto and their respective permitted successors and assigns.
            </li>
            <li><u>Export Regulation</u>. The API may be subject to US export control laws, including the US Export
                Administration Act and its associated regulations. Licensee shall not, directly or indirectly, export,
                re-export, or release the API to, or make the API accessible from, any jurisdiction or country to which
                export, re-export, or release is prohibited by law, rule, or regulation. Licensee shall comply with all
                applicable federal laws, regulations, and rules, and complete all required undertakings (including
                obtaining any necessary export license or other governmental approval), prior to exporting,
                re-exporting, releasing, or otherwise making the API available outside the US.
            </li>
            <li><u>US Government Rights</u>. Each of the Documentation and the API is a “commercial item” as that term
                is defined at 48 C.F.R. § 2.101, consisting of “commercial computer software” and “commercial computer
                software documentation” as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. § 12.212. Accordingly, if Licensee is an
                agency of the US Government or any contractor therefor, Licensee only receives those rights with respect
                to the API and Documentation as are granted to all other end users under license, in accordance with (a)
                48 C.F.R. § 227.7201 through 48 C.F.R. § 227.7204, with respect to the Department of Defense and their
                contractors, or (b) 48 C.F.R. § 12.212, with respect to all other US Government licensees and their
                contractors.
            </li>
            <li><u>Equitable Relief</u>. Each Party acknowledges and agrees that a breach or threatened breach by such
                Party of any of its obligations under Section 5 or, in the case of Licensee, Section 1, would cause the
                other Party irreparable harm for which monetary damages would not be an adequate remedy and agrees that,
                in the event of such breach or threatened breach, the other Party will be entitled to equitable relief,
                including a restraining order, an injunction, specific performance, and any other relief that may be
                available from any court, without any requirement to post a bond or other security, or to prove actual
                damages or that monetary damages are not an adequate remedy. Such remedies are not exclusive and are in
                addition to all other remedies that may be available at law, in equity, or otherwise.
            </li>
            <li><u>Counterparts</u>. This Agreement may be executed in counterparts, each of which is deemed an
                original, but all of which together are deemed to be one and the same agreement.
